#NBA home player prediction

This repo contains the code for the NBA home player prediction project.

#how to run

1. clone the repo
2. install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file
3. open the jupyter notebook file and run the code

each notebook is labeled in the following format:
knn_03-19_dataset_with_outcome.ipynb -KNN model with the dataset that has the outcome variable
knn_03-19_modified_dataset.ipynb -KNN model with the modified dataset
lgbm_03-20_modified_dataset.ipynb -LGBM model with the modified dataset
lgbm_03-20-dataset_with_outcome.ipynb -LGBM model with the dataset that has the outcome variable
rf_03-19_dataset_with_outcome.ipynb -Random Forest model with the dataset that has the outcome variable
rf_03-19_modified_dataset.ipynb -Random Forest model with the modified dataset

#Evaluation outcomes
All individual model evaluations are recorded in the 'evaluations' folder
Additionally the aggregated evaluation data, as well as model parameters can be found in 'overall_evaluation.xlsx'
